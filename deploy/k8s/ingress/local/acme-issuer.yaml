    # To ensure that you own the domain for which you will create a certificate, the ACME server will issue a challenge to a client. cert-manager provides two options for solving challenges, http01 and DNS01. In this example, the http01 challenge solver will be used and it is configured in the solvers array. cert-manager will spin up challenge solver Pods to solve the issued challenges and use Ingress resources to route the challenge to the appropriate Pod.
